## User Story
AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position

## Project Outline

In this project I was given the opportunity to show off the skills that I have acquired in the past 3 weeks. Many hours of research was put into this assignment to understand how to style my html to make my portfolio come alive. 

When my portfolio is loaded in your browser, you should be able to see my name in the heading along with links that will take you to the different section in the main body. Their will be a section about me, my work, and how to contact me. Each of the images will take you to the live page of that project.

The site can be seen in various screens and devices as responsive layout was put in place to adapt to different viewports.
